# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub Profile
<br>

Hi there! I'm **at the start of my self-taught Software Developer journey**—excited to explore the world of programming and web technologies.

<br>

## 🚀 About Me
<br>

I began learning code in **April 2023**, and I’m currently gaining foundational knowledge through:

&nbsp; 📚 **Udemy courses** focused on IT and coding basics  
&nbsp; 🏆 **CompTIA exams**, completed ITF+ and A+, next up: Linux+ and Project+  
&nbsp; ⌨️ Adopting powerful tools like **Neovim**, **tmux**, and **i3wm** on **Linux Ubuntu**  
&nbsp; 💻 Building skills in **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**  
&nbsp; 📝 I keep a regular study diary on X, sharing what I learn, tough problems, and small victories for future reference and job applications

<br>

## 🛠 Learning Path & Goals
<br>

- Focused on becoming **Full Stack**, exploring both frontend and backend
- Planning to create a project portfolio to showcase growth (coming soon!)
- Dreaming of someday founding a **Web Dev startup** (still a distant goal!)
